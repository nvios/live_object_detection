This demo was develped as an experiment to integrate a deep learning model and realtime database access into a frontend application.

The implementation is based on a training instance of the COCO dataset with over 80 labels (e.g. vehicles, animals and household objects). The experiment introduces several improvements over my <a href="https://github.com/nvios/facial_recognition">previous computer vision project</a> for real-time face recognition, written in Python and based on a Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network (MTCNN).
